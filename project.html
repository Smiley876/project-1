    <h1> CHESS</h1>
    <h6> Written by Anzel Schoon</h6>
    <h2> As Chess.com said, "Chess is easy to understand, but impossible to master."</h2>
    <h3> Chess is all about pattern recognition and theory</h3>
    <p> I am learning the Italian Game opening and my friend the Ruy Lopez. I still need to learn my notations as well
        as she does. The best thing every beginner can do is to learn the chess principles and know about back rank
        checkmate. Also you should always keep an eye on your Knight and Bishop because they can creep up to you without
        a notice if you'r not careful.</p>
    <h4> No matter the rating, the first tournament next year we are going to play together</h4>
    <h5> Wish us luck</h5>
